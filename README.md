# NPRI_Analysis
This project analyzes waste handling trends over time (landfill/disposal, treatment, and recycling/recovery) using a real dataset. I cleaned the data (handled missing values and outliers), created useful totals and yearly summaries, and used charts to highlight key patterns—such as which substances are most disposed and which regions have more facilities. To make the analysis more reliable, I reduced duplicate/overlapping information in the dataset and added simple time-trend features. Finally, I tested prediction models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to forecast future waste proportions.

We tested how waste is being managed over time—mainly recycling, treatment, and disposal (landfill)—and tried to find which option is increasing and which is decreasing. We also checked which substances show up the most and which provinces have more facilities. After that, we used the past years’ data to predict the next few years, and the overall output suggests recycling is likely to increase, while reliance on disposal/treatment may reduce slowly.
